## 🧼 Data Preparation

Performed in Python:

- Dropped irrelevant columns (EmployeeNumber, Over18, etc.)
- Encoded categorical variables (JobRole, Department, etc.)
- Handled binary columns like Attrition and OverTime
- Created new columns like TotalSatisfaction and AgeGroup
- Exported clean dataset for Power BI

---

## 📊 Analysis Highlights

- Correlation between overtime and attrition
- Higher attrition among employees aged 25–35
- Top job roles by turnover rate
- Impact of income, job satisfaction, and work-life balance on employee exits

---

## 📈 KPIs Tracked

- Attrition Rate (%)
- Avg. Monthly Income
- Avg. Satisfaction Score
- Attrition by Department and Role
- Overtime effect on attrition

---

## 📘 Dashboard (Power BI)

The dashboard provides dynamic filters and summary views:

- Attrition by demographics, job level, and compensation
- Visual breakdown of employee satisfaction
- Trend analysis by department and role

---

## ✅ Outcomes

- Cleaned and structured dataset for HR analytics
- Python notebook for EDA and insights
- Interactive dashboard for management reporting
- Clear business recommendations to reduce turnover
